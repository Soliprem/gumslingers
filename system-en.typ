== Resolution System

The system uses a 2-die roll-over mechanic based on Abilities. Each character has 6 abilities (see below).

=== Main roll

The base roll is simple:
- Roll two dice of the indicated size
- Compare them with the DC:
  - If both succeed, it's a full success: you get what you want and nothing bad happens
  - If both fail, it's a full failure: get ready for consequences (most commonly in combat, the enemy gets to do something)
  - If one succeeds, it's a mixed success: you get what you want, but you suffer some consequence (meaning that both the success and failure effects take place)
- If the two dice have _the same value_, then it's a _strong_ result: whichever effect occurs, it's going to be amplified

=== Risk roll

Sometimes a PC might want to not care about contingencies and go straight for the metaphorical kill, even at their own risk. This is the _risk roll._ Roll 1 die (subject to advantage), and treat it as if it were a pair of dice for the purposes of the main roll's degrees of success: any result is automatically a _strong_ result, and there's no mixed success.

=== Ability dice

Ability scores are tracked by increasing die size. The starting point for all abilities is d6.

#rule-box(title: [Assigning Abilities])[

  Based on character creation choices, base ability scores can change. For example, an excellent marksman might start with a d8 or d10 in Aim instead of the usual d6. Conversely, a simple farmhand might start with a d4 in Gift of the Gab.
  
  _$ "d4" <- "d6" -> "d8" -> "d10" -> "d12" $_
]

#rule-box(title: [Gunslinger Points and Pushes])[
  Each character has a pool of Gunslinger Points. These can be used to _push_ rolls, increasing the die size by one step following the usual progression:

  _$ "d4" -> "d6" -> "d8" -> "d10" -> "d12" $_

  Beyond d12, each Gunslinger Point becomes a +1. Starting from a d12 (even if pushed), 4 points can be spent to roll a d20 with no modifiers. Beyond those 4 points, you add a +1 modifier to the d20 for each additional Gunslinger Point spent.
]

You can double the effect of a push (with GM consent) by introducing a complication. Instead of a complication, the World can tally a due.

The World (personified in the GM) can keep a tally of the PC's dues. A sort of symbol of the unfair luck they might have had, or of the favours fate handed them. Fate, however, doesn't do gifts, and luck turns around.

#rule-box(title: "Dues")[
  Duesâ€”accumulated within Bargains with Fateâ€”are tokens the GM gets to spend to insert world or NPC moves while outside of the timing defined by the normal resolution system. For example, the GM might spend a token to:
  - add a complication to a scene
  - have an NPC interrupt a player turn / sequence of player turns

  #quote()[_Run, cowboy, try your best. I'll be on the other side. This check has your  signature on it, and I fully intend to cash it._]
]

Generally, Difficulty Classes are:

#table(
  columns: (1fr, auto, 2fr),
  [*Difficulty*], [*DC*], [*When to Use*],
  [Easy], [3+], [Simple tasks],
  [Simple], [5+], [Routine *challenges* for competent folk],
  [Moderate], [7+], [Significant obstacles],
  [Hard], [9+], [Expert-level tasks],
  [Legendary], [11+], [Heroic feats],
)

Favorable circumstances may grant *advantages* or *disadvantages.*

#rule-box(title: [Advantages and Disadvantages])[
  Advantage: Add a die of identical size to the one being rolledâ€”after any pushes. Take the two highest results. _An advantage can be converted to +1 up to d8, +2 up to d12, and +4 for d20_

  Disadvantage: Add a die of identical size to the one being rolledâ€”after any pushes. Take the two lowest results.
]

As with the main touchstone of this systemâ€”Gumshoeâ€”characters are presumed to be _competent._ No rolls are needed for activities that any denizen of the Old West would be able to do. Additionally, as ability levels increase, this minimum baseline for success also rises.

=== Failures and Reactions

When you (partially or fully) fail a roll, the GM presents consequences that you can react to in turn. The choice of which ability to use in your reaction depends on the situation. It's common for reaction rolls to be _risk_ rolls (though not required).

#rule-box(title: "Example")[Bob has a d8 in Aim and tries to hit NPC Alice. Alice is a bandit wanted in 20 towns, so she has a legendary DC of 11. Knowing this, Bob spends two Gunslinger Points to push his roll to a d12. Unfortunately, he rolls a 6 and a 10, thus taking a full failure. Alice now gets to shoot back at him. Bob rolls Awareness to try to find cover to mitigate the damage. He acts quickly, having no real alternatives, calling for a _risk roll._ He rolls his d6 against a simple DC of 5 because they're in a saloon full of barrels: it's a 6, so he manages to dive, taking no damage. He emerges unscathed from the situation, but is now cornered by Alice. How will he proceed?

Bob could instead choose to react with Grit. He heroically takes the bullet in the shoulder, _risk_ rolling his d10 in Grit against a legendary DC of 11. He uses a Gunslinger Point and manages to succeed by rolling an 11. Eventually he'll have to stop (he does have lead in his shoulder), but for now he doesn't give ground.]

It's reasonable for the GM to impose disadvantage on reaction rolls using the same ability that just failed (barring special circumstances).

In a reaction, you can perform quick actions that grant advantage if they present a complication.

#rule-box(title: "Example 2")[Alice is fleeing from the police when she sees a man recognize her from across the street. She approaches him to convince him not to call _the law_, but her Gift of the Gab isn't working (she rolled a 3 and a 2). The man now runs toward the sheriff. Alice reacts using her Gift of the Gab again, but the GM rules that she's rolling with disadvantage. Alice could cancel her disadvantage by drawing her gun and pointing it at the man to frighten him. Naturally, she's in town and there's people around. It might just not be worth it.]

After the first exchange occurs, the player might be tempted to keep the chain of events going: as their reaction triggers a reaction from the NPC, and so forth. Other players _can_ and probably should intervene (unless it's fun for them to watch as their friend keeps digging their own grave with more and more complications. In that case, have fun!).

=== Damage

There are 5 damage levels:
- Unharmed
- Wounded
- Badly Wounded
- Dying
- Dead

When taking damage, based on the result of your response, you can move from one level to another.

== Abilities
The six abilities are:

- Aim
- Ride
- Survival
- Grit (ability to "grit your teeth." Determines resistance to pain, for example)
- Awareness (ability to observe surroundings, actively or passively. Tracking skills)
- Gift of the Gab


=== What can they do? 

When abilities get stronger, so does the kind of thing the character can do become more and more impressive. Here below there's a list to serve as inspiration, to understand the power scaling of characters. GMs can use this list to determine what tasks requite no roll or when to award advantage / disadvantage or how to set DCs. Depending on how much rolling is desidered, one might consider as "guaranteed" either the _current_ level of the ability, or the one below. (ie, At d8, one can either consider all d8 and lower "abilities" to be automatic, or to consider "automatic" all d6 and lower).

At the same time, pushing rolls also increases in value. Beyond simply increasing die size, it can also be played with to achieve feats normally reserved off of higher "tiers", or to push the boundaries of one's competence in a creative manner. EG, a PC with d8 Aim might push their roll to also call their shot.

  [d8], [Starvation, torture, thirst. Words that'd make another cowpoke shiver that make you smile. Bring it on.],
  [d10], [Pain is just a voice in your head, and it can be tuned out. That bullet lodged within your shoulder isn't going anywhere, but you've sure got places to be.],
  [d12], [Death keeps knocking on your door, and you keep telling it to come later. You don't know what makes your bones and flows in your veins, but you know it's tough.],
  
  table.cell(rowspan: 5)[*Awareness*],
  [d4],[You couldn't spot trouble if it was wearing a bright red shirt and firing a cannon. Best keep your friends close - you'll need them to watch your back.],
  [d6],[You notice the important things - who's armed, where the exits are, when someone's obviously lying. Nothing fancy, but enough to keep you breathing.],
  [d8], [You notice the slightest bulge coming from a concealed weapon, you keep tabs on any cover around you should a gunfight arise.],
  [d10], [As you observe a person, you can tell by the look on their face how much sleep they got, if they drink. You can find small clues, even when carefully hidden.],
  [d12], [Nothing eludes your notice. Not a small change in wind that makes you easier to track, not the faint sound of padded hooves preparing an ambush. You're always ready.],
  
  table.cell(rowspan: 5)[*Gift of the Gab*],
  [d4],[Words fail you when you need them most. You stammer, you stumble, and you generally make folks wish you'd just stay quiet.],
  [d6],[You can hold a conversation without embarrassing yourself. People listen when you talk, even if they don't always like what they hear.],
  [d8], [Words, sophistry and a sly silver tongue are in your arsenal. You could sell a pharmacist into paying you to "sample" his products.],
  [d10], [The gab goes beyond the voice. It's in the tone, the manners, the gestures. You know this second layer of language and its many dialects, which change through social classes and geography.],
  [d12], [Your reputation precedes you, and it opens many, many doors. Your words carry weight, and even your enemies think themselves wise to listen to you: one such as you -they'd think- probably doesn't deal in empty threats.],

== Character Creation

*You have 8 Gunslinger Points at your disposal.* They can be kept entirely (meaning you'll have 8 Gunslinger Points available after each rest), or they can be invested in permanent improvements. Points can only be invested during character creation, or through strong narrative justification (since Gunslinger Points become a rechargeable resource once you start playing).

#rule-box(title: [Investing Gunslinger Points])[
  The cost to permanently increase an ability is:
#table(
  columns: (auto, auto, 1fr),
  [*Die Step*], [*Cost*], [*Descriptors*],
  [d6 $->$ d4], [-1 point\*], [Not great],
  [d6 $->$ d8], [1 point], [Pretty great],
  [d8 $->$ d10], [2 points], [Incredible],
  [d10 $->$ d12], [3 points], [Peak human ability],
)

\*You can lower an ability to d4 to gain one Gunslinger Point.
]

#rule-box(title: [Remaining Points])[The remaining points form the character's *Gunslinger Point limit.* There are various ways to recharge Gunslinger Points, but they can never exceed the limit (unless explicitly stated by an effect).]

=== Recovering Gunslinger Points

Gunslinger Points fully recharge after long rests (e.g., a full night). They can also be partially recovered (1-2 points) by eating, drinking, or smoking. To recharge by eating, you must dedicate time to it. For each point recharged by smoking or drinking, make a simple ability roll. If it fails, that ability is reduced by one die size until the next rest, full meal, or for the next 24 hours (whichever comes first).

=== Archetypes

These are essentially classes that are nothing more than legal combinations of what's written above.

- *Marksman*: Deadeye, a cigarette and a well-kept weapon
- *Ranger*: Horses, plains
- *Smuggler*: "Officer, I swear I don't know how that got in my bag"
- *Survivor*: After navigating a difficult life, chooses to rely more on experience than on people or fate.
